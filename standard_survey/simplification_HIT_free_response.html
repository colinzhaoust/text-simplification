<p>For this task, you are given <strong>three sentences</strong> from a set of sentences. <strong><u>Your task is to paraphrase them so that they use simpler English.</u></strong> This means you should reduce the number of difficult words or idioms, simplify complex phrasing and make the sentence more straight forward.</p>

<p>Notes and Examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>When paraphrasing, try to preserve as much of the original meaning as possible. 
	<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
	Original:<i>From its inception, it was designated a duty-free port and vied with the neighboring Sultanate of Pattani for trade. </i> <br>
	Good: <i>From the start, it was set to be a duty-free port to compete with the neighboring Sultanate of Pattani for trade. </i> <br>
	Bad: <i>It was set to be a duty-free port to compete with the neighboring Sultanate for trade. </i> <br>
	</p></li>
	<li>Proper names (e.g. John, Microsoft, Apple) , geographical locations (e.g. Northern Europe, Sultanate of Pattani), specialized technical terms (e.g. polymorphism, electro-pneumatic) or any word you dont know should be left alone when possible.</li>
	<li>You should use simpler concepts/words/phrases in your paraphrasing. This means your sentence may have more words than the original. <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
	Original: <i>He was formerly a musician.</i><br>
	Simplified: <i>He used to be a musician.</i></li>
	<li>If you cannot simplify a sentence further, you can submit the original sentence.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your work will be used to train a sentence simplification algorithm to help non-native English speakers. We will manually check a fraction of your answers and spammers will be rejected. Read the instructions and make sure you understand the task before beginning.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
